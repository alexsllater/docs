## Structure

There are 3 different apps in these repositories located in different branches and folders. Our goal is to merge them into one big project.

Folder "AppStandalone": Standalone version of the app that doesn't require any hardware to use it.

Folder "AppWithWearable": Wearable-connected version of the app that requires the "Friend necklace" to use it.

Folder "AppWithWearableReactNative": Wearable-connected version of the app that is built in React native


## Start Experimenting

We're excited to see what the community can do using our hardware and open-source software.
