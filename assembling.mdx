1. Make sure you have all of the components ready

1. You need to design the case using 3D printer. Find .stl file here. If you don't know how to do it, send this file to someone who has a 3d printer
2. Solder everything together like on the picture below. using a soldering kit.

  src="/assembly-images/assembly3.jpg"
  alt="Hero Light"

<img
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src="/assembly-images/assembly3.jpg"
  alt="Hero Dark"
/>

3. Fit everything in the case. Biggest hole is for the usb port. In my example, I put the battery first, then the board and then the switch, however it's not an ideal design. If you will figure out a better solution, please contribute!

4. Use hot glue to attach the lid to the case. You can also use a scotch tape first for testing purposes. Last, on the USB-port side, you'll find 2 small round holes. This is where the thread should go through.

Congratulations! you now have a fully working and assembled device!
