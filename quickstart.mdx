## Install the App

1. Clone the repo git clone https://github.com/BasedHardware/friend.git

2. Choose which version of the app you want to install (see Structure).

- Don't have the device? run cd apps/AppStandalone in terminal
- Have the device/NRF Board? run cd apps/AppWithWearable in terminal

3. Install Flutter and CocoaPods

4. Install your environment variables

- For AppWithWearable, open file api_calls.dart located in apps/AppWithWearable/lib/backend/api_requests  Find "Whisper" and instead of "key", provide your own api-key for openai whisper for transcriptions to work

<img
  className="block dark:hidden"
  src="/images/clean.png"
  alt="Hero Light"
/>
<img
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src="/images/clean.png"
  alt="Hero Dark"
/>

then, go to apps/AppWithWearable/lib/custom_code/actions and in the "stream_api_response" file, add your openai key instead of ""


<img
  className="block dark:hidden"
  src="/images/clean2.png"
  alt="Hero Light"
/>
<img
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src="/images/clean2.png"
  alt="Hero Dark"
/>

- For AppStandalone, update variables in in .env.template file
