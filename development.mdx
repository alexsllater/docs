1. Set up nRF Connect by following the tutorial in this video: https://youtu.be/EAJdOqsL9m8

2. In the nRF Connect Extension inside your VS Code, click "Open an existing application" and open the firmware folder from the root of this repo.

  src="/images/vscode_extension.png"
  alt="Hero Dark"
/>

3. In the application panel of the extension, click the "Add Build Configuration" icon.

  src="/images/addbuild.png"
  alt="Hero Light"

<img
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src="/images/addbuild.png"
  alt="Hero Dark"
/>

4. Choose the board as "xiao_ble_sense" and select the configuration as "prj.conf". Then, click "Build Configuration".

  src="/images/build_settings.png"
  alt="Hero Light"
/>
<img
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src="/images/build_settings.png"
  alt="Hero Dark"
/>

5. Once the build succeeds, you will find the zephyr.uf2 file in the firmware/build/zephyr directory.

6. Double-click on the reset button of the device. The device will appear on your computer as a disk. Drag and drop the zephyr.uf2 file into it.

<Info>
  **Note:** On a Mac, you might see an error message after dropping the file, indicating that the process did not complete. This is just a Mac-specific error; the firmware is successfully uploaded.

That's it! You have successfully installed the firmware on your device.

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm i -g mintlify
```

```bash yarn
yarn global add mintlify
```

</CodeGroup>

Step 2. Go to the docs are located (where you can find `mint.json`) and run the following command:

```bash
mintlify dev
```

The documentation website is now available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Custom Ports

Mintlify uses port 3000 by default. You can use the `--port` flag to customize the port Mintlify runs on. For example, use this command to run in port 3333:

```bash
mintlify dev --port 3333
```

You will see an error like this if you try to run Mintlify in a port that's already taken:

```md
Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::3000
```

## Mintlify Versions

Each CLI is linked to a specific version of Mintlify. Please update the CLI if your local website looks different than production.

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm i -g mintlify@latest
```

```bash yarn
yarn global upgrade mintlify
```

</CodeGroup>

## Deployment

<Tip>
  Unlimited editors available under the [Startup
  Plan](https://mintlify.com/pricing)
</Tip>

You should see the following if the deploy successfully went through:
